The sync has failed, which I suspect might be due to integration or network problems. I have attempted to restart and manually retry the synchronization, but the issue persists. Could you please investigate and offer a solution at your earliest convenience? If there's any additional information required from me to address this, please let me know. I am eager to hear from you. I have confirmed that both the integration settings and network are working properly, but I still encounter this issue. The data synchronization is essential for my work and needs to be resolved promptly. You can reach me at omar.hassan@secure.net.",

  "input_email_body": "Subject: Urgent: Cisco ISR4331 Issues\n\nDear Customer Support,\n\nI am writing to bring to your attention a significant issue we are facing with one of your products, the Cisco Router ISR4331. We have been utilizing this device due to its robust performance capabilities and reliability, essential for maintaining the seamless operations of our network infrastructure. However, we have recently encountered sudden performance issues that have caused serious disruptions across multiple user connections You can reach me at fatima.farsi@help.com.. This has raised considerable concern within our organization, considering the reliance we place on this router for network efficiency.\n\nThe unexpected degradation in performance manifests in slow data transmission across our network, resulting in considerable downtime and decreased productivity. We suspect that this may be attributed to either firmware glitches or potential hardware malfunction, although we couldn\u2019t determine the exact cause based solely on our internal assessment. We have exhausted initial troubleshooting protocols, including basic resets and configuration reevaluations, with no improvement.\n\nGiven the critical nature of this router to our networking operations, we urgently seek your expertise to diagnose and resolve the anomaly My name is Jane Smith.. Please let us know if there are specific diagnostic measures or updates you recommend. Additionally, if you could advise on any potential steps we might undertake to mitigate these disruptions while a solution is being identified, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you in advance for your prompt response and assistance in addressing this issue. I look forward to your guidance.\n\nSincerely,\n\n<name>",

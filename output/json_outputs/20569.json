  "input_email_body": "Subject: Request to Upgrade Microsoft Surface Pro 7\n\nDear Tech Online Store Customer Support Team,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to request information regarding the possibility of upgrading the memory and storage capabilities of my Microsoft Surface Pro 7 tablet. I currently own a unit with the base specifications, and I have seen advancements and improved performance offerings available for this model.\n\nMy unit has been performing admirably for most tasks; however, I believe that a memory and storage upgrade would allow for more efficient and effective usage, especially considering the increased demands of certain professional software that I regularly employ for my work. With the steady enhancements in software requiring more robust hardware capabilities, it's important for me to stay updated in order to maintain consistent task performance My name is Carlos Mendoza.. \n\nI understand that there can be specific guidelines and processes involved in carrying out an upgrade, and I would greatly appreciate guidance on how I might proceed. \n\nMoreover, if you could provide insight on any promotional offers or discounts currently available for these upgrades, it would be extremely beneficial. This will help in determining the best course of action moving forward.\n\nI would also like to inquire if the upgrades will necessitate shipping the device back to your service center or if this can be performed at one of your partnered service locations. An estimation of the turnaround time for such upgrades would also be appreciated.\n\nThank you for your attention and assistance in this matter You can reach me at sophia.rossi@service.it.. Please let me know the next steps or if there are any forms or documents I need to fill out to initiate this process.\n\nLooking forward to your timely response.\n\nBest regards,\n\n<name>\n<tel_num>\n<acc_num>",

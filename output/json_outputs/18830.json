The visual data analysis in my project are distorted, which affects the quality of the video editing. I have restarted my system and updated Adobe Premiere Pro to the latest version, but the problem persists. I suspect that the problem might be caused by an incompatible HDMI cable or outdated iOS 15 You can reach me at carlosm@gmail.com.. The distorted graphics appear during video editing, making it difficult to continue with the project. I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide a solution to this problem or assist me in further debugging.",

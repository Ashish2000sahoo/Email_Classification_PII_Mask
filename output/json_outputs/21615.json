  "input_email_body": "Subject: Screen Flickering Issue with MacBook Air M1 After Update\n\nDear Tech Online Store Customer Support,\n\nI am writing to bring to your attention an issue I've encountered with my MacBook Air M1, which I've been experiencing intermittently since the latest macOS update You can reach me at maria.gonzalez@shop.es.. I purchased this device from your store last year, and it has been functioning seamlessly until recently. However, following the software update, I've noticed a persistent screen flickering problem that seems to arise unexpectedly during various activities.\n\nThe screen flickering occurs randomly and affects my ability to work efficiently, which is becoming increasingly frustrating. It seems to occur particularly when switching between apps or when the device is under a specific processing load My name is Sophia Rossi.. I rely on my MacBook for both personal and professional tasks, and this disruption is quite inconvenient.\n\nI have attempted a few basic troubleshooting steps, such as restarting the device, resetting the PRAM, and ensuring all applications are up to date, but these measures have not resolved the problem. Unfortunately, the flickering often requires me to reboot the device entirely to regain use, which is not a viable long-term solution.\n\nGiven that this issue appeared shortly after the update, I believe it might be related to a software compatibility problem. I was hoping you could provide further guidance or suggest any potential fixes. If necessary, I am willing to bring the laptop in for a technical assessment and repair work.\n\nFurthermore, I would appreciate advice on whether this issue could be covered under my current warranty or AppleCare plan. Could you please inform me about any possible costs if repairs are required? I am keen to resolve this matter swiftly to avoid any further disruptions to my work.\n\nThank you in advance for your assistance and timely response. I am looking forward to hearing back from you soon so I can continue using my MacBook Air M1 without interruptions.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n<name>\n\n[Please reply to this email or contact me directly at <email> or <tel_num> for any additional information required to process this inquiry.]",

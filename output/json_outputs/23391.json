  "input_email_body": "Subject: \n\nDear Customer Support Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a bug I have encountered in Jira Software version 8.20, specifically within the aspect related to ticket management in Scrum projects. It appears that the system is failing to accurately track issues and manage their status across sprints, causing significant workflow disruptions. For example, issues that are marked as 'In Progress' occasionally revert to 'Open' without any manual intervention, and resolved tickets do not transition to 'Done' as expected when a sprint is completed. This inconsistency not only impacts our team\u2019s efficiency but also hinders our ability to meet project deadlines.\n\nThis particular bug has been pervasive across several projects within our organization, and each release iteration has exacerbated its effects. Consequently, our project managers find it increasingly challenging to generate accurate reports, plan upcoming sprints, and forecast project timelines You can reach me at fatima.farsi@help.com.. This ongoing issue necessitates a workaround, which is proving to be counterproductive and resource-intensive.\n\nWe kindly request the swift attention of your technical team to address this matter. Any guidance or a prospective timeline for resolution would be greatly appreciated My name is Sophia Rossi.. Our account details are as follows: Account Number <acc_num>.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to reach me at <tel_num> should you require further details or clarification. Thank you for your prompt attention to this issue.\n\nWarm regards,\n<name>",

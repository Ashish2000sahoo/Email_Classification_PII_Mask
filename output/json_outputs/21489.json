Recently, we have observed that the router is intermittently disconnecting from the network and displaying blinking indicator lights, which suggests potential performance issues.\n\nOur technical team inspected the device thoroughly but could not identify any visible hardware faults My name is David Kim.. This has caused significant disruption to our operations, and we are keen on resolving it at the earliest.\n\nWe kindly request your expert assistance in either dispatching a technician to inspect the router on-site or offering remote diagnostics and support You can reach me at maria.gonzalez@shop.es.. Our company greatly relies on uninterrupted network connectivity, and resolving this issue is of immediate importance to us.\n\nPlease let us know the next steps we should take to expedite this process.

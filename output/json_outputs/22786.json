I am contacting you to report a recurring problem with my Dell XPS 13 9310 laptop. Since I purchased this device, I have encountered significant performance issues during startup. Notably, the laptop frequently freezes soon after it is turned on, requiring multiple restarts before it operates properly. This matter has progressively intensified, signaling a possible underlying issue that could necessitate expert intervention.\n\nAdditionally, I have noticed that the fan noise has considerably increased since I began using the laptop. This elevated sound from the fan seems to align with moments of diminished performance, leading me to suspect a connection to the frequent freezing issues I have been experiencing.\n\nIn light of these circumstances, I would greatly appreciate it if a support technician could offer assistance or investigate this situation further to ensure that there are no hardware problems affecting the device's components. My work relies heavily on a well-functioning laptop, thus making optimal performance essential.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.\n\nKind regards,\n\n<name>\n<acc_num> You can reach me at elena.ivanova@support.org.",

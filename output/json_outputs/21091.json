  "input_email_body": "Subject: HP DeskJet 3755 Wireless Printing Issue Needs Resolution\n\nDear Customer Support,\n\nI hope this email finds you well You can reach me at david.kim@corp.kr.. I am writing to seek your assistance regarding an issue I am experiencing with my HP DeskJet 3755. Despite successfully recognizing the network and indicating a connection, the printer is not responding to any wireless printing tasks. I have tried multiple troubleshooting steps, such as restarting both the printer and my wireless modem, resetting the network settings, and ensuring that all necessary drivers and software are up to date.\n\nThis issue has been persistent, and I am unable to print any documents or images from my wireless devices, which is frustrating as I need to print materials regularly for personal and work-related purposes. Could you please provide guidance on further troubleshooting steps or confirm if this could be a hardware-related issue that might require repair or replacement?\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response to resolve this issue as soon as possible.\n\nBest Regards,\n\n<name> My name is Omar Hassan.",

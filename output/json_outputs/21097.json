The screen occasionally flickers when switching channels or apps You can reach me at janesmith@company.com.. The interruption lasts only a few seconds, but it's frequent enough to be disruptive to the viewing experience My name is Elena Ivanova.. I have already tried restarting the TV and ensuring that all cables are securely connected, but the issue persists.\n\nPlease advise on how to resolve this problem. Is there a firmware update or a setting adjustment that could address the flickering screen? If it's beyond a do-it-yourself fix, I would appreciate any guidance on repair services available for products still within warranty.\n\nLooking forward to your swift response.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n<name>\n<tel_num>\n<acc_num>",

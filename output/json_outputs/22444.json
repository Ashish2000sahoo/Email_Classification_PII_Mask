I have adhered to all the given guidelines, such as confirming that the printer is on the same wireless network as my mobile device and making sure that the Canon PRINT application is fully updated.\n\nDespite my best efforts, I am unable to successfully print directly from my smartphone My name is David Kim.. The device appears in the app; however, shortly after I initiate a print job, it ceases to function and shows an error message. I have also rebooted both the printer and my mobile device, yet the situation remains unchanged.\n\nCould you assist me by providing further troubleshooting advice or let me know if this is a recognized problem with a proposed fix?

I am reaching out to request help regarding a Dell XPS 13 9310 laptop that I bought from your store You can reach me at omar.hassan@secure.net.. Lately, I have been facing a continual problem with the laptop's sound system, which is affecting both the internal speakers and any external audio devices connected to it.\n\nI have tried numerous troubleshooting methods and made adjustments to various settings I found online, yet the issue remains unresolved. The audio output appears to be distorted, and occasionally it stops completely. This problem is hindering my ability to effectively use the laptop for both personal and work-related tasks.\n\nCould you kindly instruct me on the next steps for further troubleshooting or, if needed, help me initiate a service request for technical support?

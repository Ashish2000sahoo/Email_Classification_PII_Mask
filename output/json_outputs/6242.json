The issues began after I updated MongoDB 4.4 and Redis 6.2 My name is Omar Hassan.. I have already tried restarting the laptop and no improvement has been observed. I suspect that the problem could be due to conflicts between the outdated Ubuntu version and ESET NOD32 Antivirus. I am looking for assistance in resolving this issue. Could you please guide me through any steps that might help troubleshoot the problem? I am willing to provide any additional information necessary to help solve it. I am awaiting your prompt response and assistance. I am counting on your support for a quick resolution to these issues. You can reach me at david.kim@corp.kr.",
